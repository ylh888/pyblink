py-opencv/pyblink
--- python eye blink switch control
--- based on eyespy (webcam_surv.py webcam surveillance software) 
    AND webcam_fall.py fall detection software
--- try to recreate and improve on node.js version's nblink
    which no longer works because of opencv problems

=== relevant files: pyblink.py, imgproc/, pyimagesearch
>>>./xgo which executes xblink when py src files have changed
 ls *.py imgproc/*.py | entr -pr ./xblink
 
>>>./xblink - runs python pyblink --conf conf.json


=== IN PROCESS 2018-06-03
_ make a detector class
_ make a improc class


=== NEXT
_ train from stored movie

eyespy - code from web surveillance
*-object-dection - code from pyimage object-detection - NOT USED
