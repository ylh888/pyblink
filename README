py-opencv/pyblink
- python eye blink switch control
- based on eyespy (webcam_surv.py webcam surveillance software) 
    AND webcam_fall.py fall detection software
- try to recreate and improve on node.js version's nblink
    which no longer works because of opencv problems

>>> MUST source ~/.bash_profile AND workon p3 (on Mac or workon cv2 on PI)


=== relevant files: pyblink.py, imgproc/, pyimagesearch
>>>./xgo which executes xblink when py src files have changed
 ls *.py imgproc/*.py | entr -pr ./xblink
>>>./xblink - runs python pyblink --conf conf.json
